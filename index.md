# Welcome

_Welcome to the STM32-base project documentation!_ Here you will find guides, cheatsheets and background information on anything related to the [STM32-base project](https://github.com/STM32-base). The purpose of the STM32-base project is to provide you with a simple and easy to understand starting point for programming STM32 microcontrollers.

**WARNING: This project is work in progress! Anything can (and probably will) change! Do not use the code found in this project for any critical system(s). The use of the code and documentation is at your own risk!**
