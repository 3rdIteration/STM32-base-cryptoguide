# Welcome

_Welcome to the STM32-base project Github pages!_ These pages provide guides, cheatsheets and background information on all things related to the [STM32-base project](https://github.com/STM32-base).

**WARNING: This project is work in progress! Anything can (and probably will) change! Do not use the code found in this project for any critical system(s). The use of this code is at your own risk!**

## Setup

When you are looking to get started, take a look at the `README.md` of the [STM32-base repository](https://github.com/STM32-base/STM32-base). For a more extensive setup guide, see this [Setup Guide]({{ site.url }}/guides/setup).

## Flashing

## About this project & me

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple and easy to use starting point (base) for programming STM32 series microcontrollers using an open-source toolchain. Most other projects and tutorials assume the make files, startup code, and CMSIS are already there and consider them as black boxes. Because of that, most of these projects and tutorials do not include any explanation on what these files are, what these files do and how the toolchain works.

That is the main reason I started working on this project, as I _do_ want to understand how the toolchain works and what role each file plays during development. I therefore took a deep dive in the world of programming ARM-based microcontrollers and wanted to document my findings somewhere. I did not have any prior experience with ARM microcontrollers and more general, bare-metal programming microcontrollers. I hope this project is helpful to those who are interested in programming STM32 microcontrollers and to those who want to know more about the open-source ARM toolchain.

My name it Thomas Gravekamp. At this moment, I'm the only contributor to this project. To learn more about me and the things I do, visit my website at [thomas-gravekamp.nl](https://thomas-gravekamp.nl/). I am in no way affiliated with ST Microelectronics.
