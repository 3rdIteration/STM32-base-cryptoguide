# Welcome

_Welcome to the STM32-base project documentation!_ Here you will find documentation related to the [STM32-base project](https://github.com/STM32-base) and [STM32 microcontrollers](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32-32-bit-arm-cortex-mcus.html).

**WARNING: This project is work in progress! Anything can (and probably will) change! Do not use the code found in this project for any critical system(s). The use of the code and documentation is at your own risk!**

## About

The purpose of the STM32-base project is to provide you with a simple and easy to use base project for working with STM32 microcontrollers. More information on why this project came into being can be found on the [about page]({{ site.url }}/general/about).

The STM32-base project is divided over multiple Github repositories. See the [project overview page]({{ site.url }}/general/overview) to get an overview of the repositories and how they relate to each other.

## Getting started

Check out the [getting started with STM32 microcontrollers guide]({{ site.url }}/guides/getting-started). This guide is intended for beginners who want to get started with STM32 microcontrollers but don't know _how_ or _where_ to get started.

You can get started with the STM32-base project by reading the [setup guide]({{ site.url }}/guides/setup). A brief version of this guide is included in the [`README.md` of the STM32-base repository](https://github.com/STM32-base/STM32-base).

## Boards

The STM32-base documentation contains a lot of information on many different STM32 development boards. A lot of the Chinese STM32 development boards that are available are listed on the [board page]({{ site.url }}/boards).

## Contributing

Refer to the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/STM32-base/STM32-base/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file to learn more about contributing to the STM32-base project. Take a look at the [roadmap]({{ site.url }}/general/roadmap) if you are looking for things to work on.
