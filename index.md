# Welcome

_Welcome to the STM32-base project documentation!_ Here you will find documentation related to the [STM32-base project](https://github.com/STM32-base) and [STM32 microcontrollers](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32-32-bit-arm-cortex-mcus.html).

**WARNING: This project is work in progress! Anything can (and probably will) change! Do not use the code found in this project for any critical system(s). The use of the code and documentation is at your own risk!**

## Getting started

If you don't know how or where to get started, check out the [getting started with STM32 microcontrollers guide]({{ site.url }}/guides/getting-started). This guide will introduce you to all the different ways you can get started with STM32 microcontrollers.

Start with the [setup guide]({{ site.url }}/guides/setup) if you want to get started with the STM32-base project. A shorter version of this guide is included in the [`README.md` of the STM32-base repository](https://github.com/STM32-base/STM32-base).

## Boards

This website contains a lot of information on many different STM32 development boards. Many Chinese STM32 development boards are listed on the [boards page]({{ site.url }}/boards). You can find the popular [Blue Pill]({{ site.url }}/boards/STM32F103C8T6-Blue-Pill) and [Black Pill]({{ site.url }}/boards/STM32F103C8T6-Black-Pill) boards there too!

## About

The purpose of the STM32-base project is to provide you with a simple and easy to use base project for working with STM32 microcontrollers. More information on why this project came into being can be found on the [about page]({{ site.url }}/general/about).

The STM32-base project is divided over multiple Github repositories. See the [project overview page]({{ site.url }}/general/overview) to get an overview of the repositories and how they relate to each other.
