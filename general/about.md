# {{ page.title }}

The purpose of the STM32-base project is to provide a simple and easy to use base project for working with STM32 microcontrollers. This project is intended for those who want to know how everything they're using works.

Most tutorials, guides, and projects are focussed on getting you started as fast as possible. They are written with the assumption that the make files, linker scripts, startup code, and CMSIS are already present and consider them black boxes.

A lot of important and interesting information is left out of tutorials and guides because of that assumption. When working with these microcontrollers, I _do_ want to know how everything works. That was the main reason I started this project.

I had no experience with bare-metal programming microcontrollers prior to this project. I took a deep dive into the world of programming STM32 microcontrollers. As I learned more and more, I felt the need for some place to document my findings.

That was the moment this project started. This project merely scratches the surface of programming STM32 microcontrollers and is nowhere near complete. There is so much to more learn and discover.

I hope that this project is helpful for those who want to start working with STM32 microcontrollers and feel the same need to know how everything works. To learn more about me and the things I do, visit my website at [thomas-gravekamp.nl](https://thomas-gravekamp.nl).

I am in no way affiliated with [STMicroelectronics](https://www.st.com). This is just a personal hobby project.
