# {{ page.title }}

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple and easy to use base project for programming STM32 microcontrollers using an open-source toolchain. Most other projects and tutorials assume the makefiles, linker scripts, startup code, and CMSIS are already present and consider them black boxes. Because of that, most of these projects and tutorials do not bother to explain what these files are, what they do, and how the toolchain works. Their main focus lies on getting the user set up as quickly as posible.

That was the main reason I started this project. When working with these microcontrollers, I _do_ want to know how everything works. I had no prior experience with bare-metal programming microcontrollers, so I took a deep dive into the world of programming (in this case ARM-based) microcontrollers. As I was learning about the ARM toolchain and STM32 devices I needed some place to document my findings. This project is the result of that. Still, this project only scratches the surface of programming ARM microcontrollers. There is so much more to learn and discover. If you are interested in programming STM32 microcontrollers, keep an eye on this project!

I hope this project is helpful to those who are interested in programming STM32 microcontrollers and to those who want to know more about the open-source ARM toolchain and STM32 microcontrollers.
