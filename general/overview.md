# {{ page.title }}

Over time, the STM32-base project grew in both size and complexity and is still growing. This page should give an overview of all these components.

## Github organization

The [STM32-base Github](https://github.com/STM32-base) organization is the place where everything comes together. The organization is used to keep all STM32-base related repositories organized. This website is hosted on the Github pages platform. Using a Github organization allowed for a much nicer URL (stm32-base.github.io). The source for this website can be found in its own [repository](https://github.com/STM32-base/STM32-base.github.io).

## Code repositories

The code of this project is located in a single repository. It contains the [STM32-base project](https://github.com/STM32-base/STM32-base) itself. The startup code, linker scripts and makefiles are located in that repository. Then there is the [STM32-base-STM32Cube repository](https://github.com/STM32-base/STM32-base-STM32Cube). This repository contains the CMSIS and HAL coded as provided by STMicroelectronics.

## Project templates

Each supported device series has its own project template repository. These templates provide an easy starting point for an STM32-base based project. Currently, the [STM32F0](https://github.com/STM32-base/STM32-base-F0-template), [STM32F1](https://github.com/STM32-base/STM32-base-F1-template), [STM32F2](https://github.com/STM32-base/STM32-base-F2-template), [STM32F3](https://github.com/STM32-base/STM32-base-F3-template), [STM32F4](https://github.com/STM32-base/STM32-base-F4-template), and [STM32F7](https://github.com/STM32-base/STM32-base-F7-template) series are supported.
