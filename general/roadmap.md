On this page you will find information on the roadmap and the scope of this project.

## Roadmap

The roadmap for the STM32-base project has been moved to a [Github project](https://github.com/orgs/STM32-base/projects/1). Issues created on either the [STM32-base](https://github.com/STM32-base/STM32-base) or the [STM32-base.github.io](https://github.com/STM32-base/STM32-base.github.io) repositories are tracked with in that project.

Issues listed on the project board are not guaranteed to be handled within a certain time frame. For now, the project board is a nice way to keep track of things that still need to be done.

## Scope

The scope of a project like this one can grow rapidly. Therefore it is important to keep an eye on what should and what should not be a part of the STM32-base project.

If you have read the [about page]({{ site.url }}/general/about), you will know that the purpose of the STM32-base project is to provide you with a simple and easy to use base project for working with STM32 microcontrollers.

To keep things simple and easy to use, the STM32-base repository is limited to makefiles, linker scripts, and startup code. It will not contain any C or C++ code. The project templates are limited to only those files that are required to make the example project work.

All work on the STM32-base project is currently aimed at improving the documentation and polishing the base project. There are still a few major issues that need to be solved.
