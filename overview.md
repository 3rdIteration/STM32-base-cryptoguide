# {{ page.title }}

The STM32-base project grew in complexity over time. It is currently organized in multiple repositories that all serve a specific function within the STM32-base project. This page should provide you with an overview of all the repositories and pages that are a part of the STM32-base project.

## STM32-base project

The STM32-base project itself is organized as a Github organization to keep all the related repositories together in a single place. This organization is the owner of all the repositories that are a part of the STM32-base project. You can find the STM32-base project organization page [here](https://github.com/STM32-base). The Github pages repository for the documentation you are reading right now can be found [here](https://github.com/STM32-base/STM32-base.github.io).

## STM32-base code repository

The base of the STM32-base project can be found in the [STM32-base repository](https://github.com/STM32-base/STM32-base). This repository contains all the make files, linker scripts and startup code. You _need_ this repository to use the STM32-base project.

## STM32-base project templates

The STM32-base project templates provide an easy starting point for an STM32-base based project. Each supported chip series has its own template. Currently, the [STM32F0](https://github.com/STM32-base/STM32-base-F0-template), [STM32F1](https://github.com/STM32-base/STM32-base-F1-template), [STM32F2](https://github.com/STM32-base/STM32-base-F2-template), [STM32F3](https://github.com/STM32-base/STM32-base-F3-template), [STM32F4](https://github.com/STM32-base/STM32-base-F4-template), and [STM32F7](https://github.com/STM32-base/STM32-base-F7-template) series are supported.
